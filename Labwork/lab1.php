            echo "<p> I found this assignment to be a refreshing review of html and basic php, though some of the intricacies of git were hard to parse at first. Two of my favorite websites which used for reference when coding this page are <a href='https://www.w3schools.com'>W3Schools</a> and <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/'>Stack Overflow</a>. <br> 
            I also used <a href='http://git.huit.harvard.edu/guide/'>this</a> git reference page.</p>";
